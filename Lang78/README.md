# Lang78

- Insensitive to currying/uncurrying
- Associative products with identity
- Able to match types more general than the query type

```text
> a * b -> a
const : a -> b -> a
  by instantiating {a := a, b := b}

fst : a * b -> a
  by instantiating {a := a, b := b}

bimap : (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> a * c -> b * d
  by instantiating {a := b, b := (), c := (), d := a}
```
